# limeline

My simple statusbar for tmux insired by [Powerline](https://github.com/powerline/powerline) and [vim-airline](https://github.com/bling/vim-airline)

## Status

Just started. I love [Powerline](https://github.com/powerline/powerline) but I suck at Python and always seem to have
trouble installing it. I already use [vim-airline](https://github.com/bling/vim-airline) for vim; this is my quick fix
to reproduce my powerline statusbar without powerline.

## Installing

Get the binary the Go way:

```
$ go get github.com/mcartmell/limeline
```

## TODO

* Configurable panes
* Colours
* Daemon mode
* Plugins
